To run the program in commnad line 
   enter to the folder bestPlacesForKitchenEx in the command line
   and do :   javac kitchenPath.java (I already compiled it)
   and to load: java kitchenPath   src/floorMap.txt
                                  [ arg of filename with 
								    relative path with plan]
				if you dont enter file path you will
                      be able enter it after it run or
                         use default example I wrote 
                              files/floorMap.txt at src folder
In program like eclipse you will able choose file or use default.
pay attention in eclipse or etc. the path should start from src 
				 like: src/files/floorMap.txt
